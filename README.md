# NetCore.Nunit.Selenium
This is a basic sample UI test using Selenium, NUnit and .NET Core

# Background
In order to explore various programming languages, testing and UI automation frameworks, I thought I will take an imagninary basic sample test case below and try to automate the same test case using various different frameworks and languages.

# Test Case
1. Navigate to a page that contains a form (https://www.seleniumeasy.com/test/basic-first-form-demo.html)
2. Identify the text box and enter the test message "Hello World.."
3. Verify if the same test message is displayed in the label below.
4. Navigate to the next page containing a check box (https://www.seleniumeasy.com/test/basic-checkbox-demo.html).
5. Tick (check) the check box.
6. Verify if the "Success - Check box is checked" message is displayed.
